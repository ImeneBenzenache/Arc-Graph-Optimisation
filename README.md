# Arc-Graph-Optimisation
This program is used to visualize the optimization of an arc graph using D3.js

This is a program that visualizes each step of an algorithm for the optimisation of arc graphs.
First step is to create the graph by giving the number of nodes and the neighbors of each node. 
Then hit go to see the first visualization of the graph. 
On every click on the canvas, the graph will be updated after having made some calculations. 
When the graph reaches stability (its most optimized form), a pop up will say that you've reached stability.
